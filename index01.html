      <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">The Foundation of Smart Systems</p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the driving force behind modern automation, enabling machines to mimic human cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning. AI is revolutionizing sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing by improving efficiency, enhancing data-driven decision-making, and personalizing user experiences.

        Key AI applications include:
        
        Computer Vision – Enabling machines to interpret and process visual information.
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Allowing AI to understand and generate human language.
        Robotic Process Automation (RPA) – Automating repetitive tasks to boost productivity.</p>

    <section id="ml">
      <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
      <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. ML algorithms are used in applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="rag">
      <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>
      <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models. It enhances AI systems by allowing them to retrieve relevant information from large datasets and generate accurate, context-aware responses. RAG is particularly useful in chatbots, question-answering systems, and content creation.</p>
